### Project Overview
This is a ML/AI program to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier, optimized with StratifiedKFold and RandomizedSearchCV. Due to the use-case of the model, the algorithm is optimized to minimize false negatives.

This program was created and tested using VSCode V1.99 on Linux Mint.

### C.1. Requirements
#### Software
- VSCode 1.99
- Python 3.10.12
- Git (for cloning repository, version control)
#### Libraries
- matplotlib==3.10.1
- seaborn==0.13.2
- joblib==1.4.2
- pandas==2.2.3
- numpy==2.2.5
- scikit-learn==1.6.1
#### Hardware
- Minimum of 4GB RAM Recommended

### C.2. Instructions
1. Clone the program repository:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/wgu-gitlab-environment/student-repos/bweppl1/d683-advanced-ai-and-ml.git
```

2. Install requirements:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new patients:
```bash
python optimized_model.py
```
